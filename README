# Different workflows
We can do three kinds of things with these scripts.
1. Recording with caption
2. Multi-layered recording
3. Looped recording (this is mostly a work in progress)

Generally, for step 1 we have to do:
1. `./STEP-1.sh`
2. Edit caption.json and gridspec.json (optionally use `make_caption_spec.py` to make caption.json) 
3. `./STEP-2.sh`
